<p>The below post from <a href="https://bitquabit.com/post/working-remotely-coworking-and-mental-health/">bitquabit.com</a> is the first-hand experience of a software developer who moved to remote working and 
later coworking. It is a reminder of the importance of providing the right workplace for team members and
that not all people thrive in the same environments. Workplaces need to cater to the needs of all team members
in order to provide a stimulating and comfortable environment.</p>

<p>The importance of workplace to the experience of employees is captured in the below quote from the post.

<blockquote class="custom-quote">
    <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>Things finally came to a head one February evening when I had an emotional 
    	breakdown. I wrapped up a completely normal and uneventful day at work, did my fifteen foot commute from 
    	my office to my living room, and promptly found myself vomiting from stress, saying how much I hated–truly 
    	hated–my job, and crying as I realized how unhappy I was with my new life.</p>
