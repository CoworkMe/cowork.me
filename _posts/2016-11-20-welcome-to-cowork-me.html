<p>Work is changing. The notion of a "Workplace" - the place where real work gets done - is becoming more
	difficult to clearly define. Work is now more correctly defined as the thing we do, and not so
much the place in which we've traditionally done it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
 This site is where we explore the new way of working. This includes alternate physical locations such as
 co-working spaces, so-called "third-places" such as cafes and coffee shops as well as the new way in which work
 gets done by short-term freelance workers, contingent workers or salaried employees with flexible working hours.
</p>

<p>
	Enabling these new ways and places of working are the trifecta of factors being mobile device performance,
	cloud-based software and tools, and a growing model of contingent or freelance workers who a forced to or
	more likely decide to modify their working model to pursue other projects, jobs or hobbies.
</p>

<p>We plan to explore these trends and look at how companies and individuals are making this new model work
for them.</p>
